# HardwareAssembler
Automate setup of hardware components and dependencies

Note: This script was one I used in CDA4101 for running projects (mainly compiling Quartus and ModelSim
files and running testbenches).
You will not use the exact code for your task; but it's mainly to provide an idea of how to compile/run
BDF and Verilog files from the command line.
